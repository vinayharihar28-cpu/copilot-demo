1. Reviewing and Validating AI-Generated Code

Always manually review code generated by AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT).

Validate the logic, performance, and correctness before using it.

Check for hardcoded credentials, insecure endpoints, or missing validations.

Ensure the code meets your project’s style, maintainability, and security standards.

2. Handling Sensitive Data Securely

Never store API keys, passwords, or tokens inside AI-generated code.

Use .env files or secret managers for storing sensitive data.

Ensure all network calls use HTTPS and follow secure data transfer practices.

Do not share private or confidential data as input to AI tools.

3. Acknowledging AI Contributions Ethically

When significant code or documentation is AI-generated, acknowledge the use of AI tools.

Ensure that any AI-generated content aligns with open-source licensing rules.

Avoid misrepresenting AI-suggested work as entirely human-created.

Add comments in code where AI assistance was used, when appropriate.
