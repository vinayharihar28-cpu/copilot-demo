# Ethical Concerns of Using AI Tools like Copilot

## 1. Copyright & Licensing Issues
Copilot may generate code similar to copyrighted content.  
**Example:** Suggesting GPL-licensed code for a private project.  
**Solution:** Review AI-generated code and avoid long automatic blocks.

## 2. Security Risks
AI tools might produce insecure patterns (e.g., unsafe SQL).  
**Example:** Copilot generates SQL without input validation.  
**Solution:** Apply secure coding manually and use code scanners.

## 3. Over-reliance on AI
Developers may lose problem-solving skills when AI solves everything.  
**Example:** Students unable to write recursion without Copilot.  
**Solution:** Use AI as support, not replacement; do core logic manually.
